## üîç Common Questions

### Q: Why is data generated instead of real historical data?
**A:** Real historical NAV data requires paid API access. The app generates statistically realistic data based on current NAV and category-specific return/volatility characteristics. For actual investments, verify with fund factsheets.

### Q: Can I analyze NFO (New Fund Offerings)?
**A:** Only funds with established NAV history can be analyzed. NFOs need at least 6-12 months of track record.

### Q: Which time period should I focus on?
**A:** For equity funds, 3-year and 5-year periods are most meaningful. For debt funds, 1-year is sufficient. Short-term periods (1M, 3M) are too volatile.

### Q: How accurate are the AI recommendations?
**A:** Recommendations are based on quantitative metrics only. Always consider qualitative factors (fund manager, investment philosophy, portfolio composition) and consult a financial advisor.

### Q: Can I save my analysis?
**A:** Currently, you can export to PDF/CSV for saving. Browser cache saves selected funds temporarily.
